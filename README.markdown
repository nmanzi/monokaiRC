## A [Linkinus 2.0](http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus) style - irssi-like with a [monokai](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/) colour scheme ##

### Installation ###

Installation requires git to be installed.

You can install git via macports (git-core) or fink. You can also download a binary package from [http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/)

To install this style:

1.  Open Terminal.app (in Applications/Utilities)
2.  Clone this repository into any directory in your home folder (~/Downloads perhaps?) with the following command:
    git clone git://github.com/nmanzi/monokaiRC.git
3.  Open the folder in Finder and double-click on the monokaiRC.lnk2style file. This will open Linkinus and install the style.
    Alternatively, you can move the lnk2style file into ~/Library/Application Support/Linkinus 2/Styles/
